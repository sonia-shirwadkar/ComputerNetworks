The API documentation is organized as follows:
index.html: This is the main file for the online documentation
shardapi/index.html: This file contains documentation for the shards
client/index.html: This file contains documentation for the client
monitor/index.html: This file contains documentation for the monitor

On viewing the main index.html file, you will see tabs for Shard, Client and Monitor on the left side of the page.
On some machines, clicking on the tab will take you to an intermediate page containing a link to index.html. Click index.html to view tab content.
